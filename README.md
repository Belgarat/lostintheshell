# lostintheshell

## Overview

This project is a web application designed to track and analyze user interactions, specifically click events, on a landing page or set of landing pages. It enables the logging and analysis of user clicks, including the click type (e.g., "view", "amazon", "download"), the landing page URL, the user's IP address, and the user agent. The application provides basic statistics, such as total clicks, clicks by type, bounce rate, and a list of recent events. This repository contains the source code for the backend API endpoints and configuration files. The frontend, which interacts with these APIs, is implied but not included in this repository. The target users are website owners and marketers who want to understand user behavior on their landing pages. This project provides the tools to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of landing pages and track user engagement.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version specified in `package.json` if any)
*   npm or yarn (package manager)
*   A Supabase project (with the URL and Anon Key)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Belgarat/lostintheshell.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  Set up environment variables:

    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    *   Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your Supabase project's credentials:

        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```

### Build and Run

1.  Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```

2.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env.local` file or as configured in `next.config.ts`).

### Module Usage

*   **Supabase Client:**

    *   The `supabase` client, initialized in `app/lib/supabase.ts`, is used to interact with your Supabase project.
    *   To use the Supabase client:

        ```typescript
        // app/api/example/route.ts
        import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
        import { supabase } from '@/app/lib/supabase';

        export async function GET() {
          const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('your_table_name')
            .select('*');

          if (error) {
            console.error('Supabase error:', error);
            return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 });
          }

          return NextResponse.json({ data });
        }
        ```

        *   The code imports the `supabase` client.
        *   It then uses the client to perform database operations (e.g., selecting data from a table).
        *   Error handling is included.

*   **API Routes:**

    *   The API routes (`/api/log-click` and `/api/stats`) are used to handle incoming requests.
    *   They are designed to be called from the frontend. The `/api/log-click` route is used to log click events to Supabase, and the `/api/stats` route is used to retrieve statistics.

### Deployment

*   Deploy the Next.js application to a platform that supports Next.js, such as Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
*   Configure the environment variables on the deployment platform.

## Functional Analysis

### 1. Main Responsibilities of the System

The primary responsibilities of this system are:

*   **Click Event Tracking:** To record user interactions (clicks) on a landing page or set of landing pages.  This involves capturing the type of click, the landing page URL, the user's IP address, and the user agent.
*   **Data Storage:** To store the tracked click event data in a Supabase database.
*   **Statistics Generation:** To calculate and provide basic statistics about the click events, such as total clicks, clicks by type, and bounce rate.
*   **Data Retrieval:** To provide an API endpoint for retrieving click statistics, filtered by landing page.

The system provides a foundational service for tracking and analyzing user behavior on landing pages. It orchestrates the logging of events, storage of data, and calculation of key metrics.

### 2. Problems the System Solves

This system addresses the following problems:

*   **Lack of User Interaction Data:**  Provides a mechanism to capture and record user interactions on landing pages, which is essential for understanding user behavior and optimizing landing page performance.
*   **Difficulty in Tracking Click Events:** Simplifies the process of tracking click events by providing API endpoints for logging and retrieving data.
*   **Need for Basic Analytics:**  Offers basic analytics (total clicks, clicks by type, bounce rate) to provide insights into landing page performance.  This helps users understand how users are interacting with their pages.
*   **Manual Data Analysis:** Automates data collection and initial analysis, saving time and effort compared to manual data gathering.

The system solves the problem of gaining insights into user behavior on landing pages, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimization.

### 3. Interaction of Modules and Components

The system's modules and components interact as follows:

1.  **Frontend (Implied):**
    *   The frontend (likely built with React and Next.js) is responsible for:
        *   Detecting user interactions (e.g., clicks).
        *   Sending POST requests to the `/api/log-click` endpoint with click event data.
        *   Sending GET requests to the `/api/stats` endpoint to retrieve statistics.
        *   Displaying the retrieved statistics to the user.
2.  **`/api/log-click/route.ts` (API Route):**
    *   Receives POST requests from the frontend containing click event data (`type`, `landing`).
    *   Extracts the user's IP address and user agent from the request headers.
    *   Uses the `supabase` client (initialized in `app/lib/supabase.ts`) to insert the click event data into the `clicks` table in Supabase.
    *   Returns a JSON response indicating success or an error.
3.  **`/api/stats/route.ts` (API Route):**
    *   Receives GET requests from the frontend, including a `landing` parameter (to filter statistics).
    *   Uses the `supabase` client to query the `clicks` table in Supabase, filtering by the `landing` parameter.
    *   Calculates statistics based on the retrieved data (total clicks, clicks by type, bounce rate).
    *   Returns a JSON response containing the calculated statistics and the last 10 click events.
4.  **`app/lib/supabase.ts` (Module):**
    *   Initializes the `supabase` client using the Supabase URL and Anon Key from environment variables.
    *   Provides a reusable `supabase` client instance to the API routes.
5.  **Supabase Database:**
    *   Stores the click event data in the `clicks` table.
    *   The API routes interact with the database via the `supabase` client.

The frontend triggers the data flow. The API routes handle the business logic (logging and retrieving data) and interact with the Supabase database through the `supabase` client.

### 4. User-Facing vs. System-Facing Functionalities

*   **User-Facing Functionalities (Frontend):**
    *   Displaying landing pages.
    *   Tracking user clicks on interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.).
    *   Displaying analytics data retrieved from the `/api/stats` endpoint (e.g., total clicks, bounce rate).
*   **System-Facing Functionalities (Backend):**
    *   `/api/log-click/route.ts`:
        *   Receiving click event data from the frontend.
        *   Logging the event data to the Supabase database.
    *   `/api/stats/route.ts`:
        *   Retrieving click event data from the Supabase database.
        *   Calculating statistics.
        *   Providing the calculated statistics to the frontend.
    *   `app/lib/supabase.ts`:
        *   Initializing and providing the Supabase client for database interaction.

The frontend provides the user interface and interacts with the API endpoints. The backend API routes handle the data processing and interaction with the database.

## Architectural Patterns and Design Principles Applied

*   **API Routes (Next.js):** The use of Next.js API routes (`/api/log-click/route.ts`, `/api/stats/route.ts`) encapsulates backend logic within the Next.js application, providing a convenient way to create API endpoints.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The `supabase` client is created in `app/lib/supabase.ts` and then imported and used in the API routes. This promotes reusability and testability.
*   **Separation of Concerns:** The code is organized to separate concerns:
    *   `tailwind.config.ts`:  Handles Tailwind CSS configuration.
    *   `next.config.ts`: Handles Next.js configuration.
    *   `app/lib/supabase.ts`: Handles Supabase client initialization.
    *   `app/api/log-click/route.ts`: Handles click logging logic.
    *   `app/api/stats/route.ts`:  Handles statistics calculation and retrieval.
*   **Data Fetching (Server-Side):** The `stats` route uses server-side data fetching to retrieve data from Supabase directly on the server, improving performance and security.
*   **Environment Variables:** Environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are used to store sensitive information (Supabase credentials), which is a good security practice.

    "**Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to improve code coverage and ensure the reliability of the application. Focus on testing the API routes (`/api/log-click/route.ts`, `/api/stats/route.ts`) and the Supabase interactions.",
    "**Error Handling:** Improve error handling in the API routes.  While the provided code includes basic error handling, it could be expanded to include more specific error messages and logging. Consider using a dedicated error handling library or middleware.",
    "**Input Validation:** Validate the input data received by the `/api/log-click` route to prevent potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection if the data is used in a database query) and ensure data integrity. Validate the `landing` parameter in the `/api/stats` route."
  ]
}
```

The code quality analysis highlights potential areas for improvement:

*   **Security:** The use of the Supabase Anon Key directly in the client-side code could pose a security risk.
*   **Code Smells:** Unused imports, empty blocks, and magic numbers reduce code readability and maintainability.
*   **Testing:** Lack of code coverage could lead to undetected bugs.
